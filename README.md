# NEST Home
NEST Home is an Indigo plug-in that is designed to support the 
management of multiple NEST Thermostats and NEST Protects in a single 
location. I like my NESTs and theyâ€™re really good at what they do but I 
just feel that I could achieve even more if I could link them to my Home 
Automation Server.
